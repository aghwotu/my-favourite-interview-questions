1. What separates someone who is adequate at this position from someone who is exceptional at this position?
2. "What would someone need to do in their first three months/six months/year in this job in order to be considered successful?" It shows that you're looking beyond simply getting hired and that you want to be a hot runner right out of the gate.
3. My go-to when they ask is to say, "did any of my answers raise any areas of concern? Or would you like any more clarification on anything?" Never leave and say you don't have any other questions. Ask about the next steps for the hiring process, when they expect to make a decision. Always find a way to ask the interviewer. What skills would a candidate have that would make them excel in the role, then spin that around and give examples of how you have those skills. Interviewing gets better with practice, I was lucky enough to have a manager early in my career to help me do mock interviews.
4. What is the growth opportunity in this role? That way they know you are interested in moving up and will be ready when you ask for a promotion 1-2 years in.
    - As someone who has been hired by every company I've interviewed with (around 11) I always respond with a few from this group:
    - What do you most love about working here?
    -  What do you most love about working here?
    -  What goals does this department and/or this company want to meet this year? 
    -  If there was anything specific mentioned that I want more info about I to ask it at this point in the interview.
5. I ask, “what do you wish people would ask you, but they never do?” It always throws them off, but it always impresses.
6. Do you have any concerns about my qualifications right now that would prevent you from hiring me?
    - This lets you directly address things that might be keeping them from considering you, and if you answer well, will erase those concerns. The trick is that you need to know your weaknesses in advance and have good explanations (not excuses) so you're not caught off-guard.
7. Do you have any concerns in my skills or ability to perform the job?
8. Ask the following: “Say you hire me for this position. How will you know a year from now that you made the right decision in hiring me? In other words, What characteristics will I have and what will I have done here by that point?”
    - That way they are looking at you while describing the perfect candidate to get in their heads that you are the perfect candidate. And also its good to know for you.
9. I usually end with, “Do you see any reason why I wouldn’t be a great candidate for this position.” I find it to be a strong question to end on and allows you to reaffirm your strengths if they do find a problem.
10. "What do you think the biggest challenge for someone coming into this position would be?"
    - "In the context of this position, how would you define success?"
    - "What would you like to see accomplished in the first 90 days?"
11.  My goto is always: if there is a second interview, what skill set would you like me to be more up to speed on by that time? (Work in technology). Shows that you’re interested in being a better fit for them, likes to learn, a go getter, and all that shit.
12. Is there anything I could have done during this interview to improve my chances?
Whatever the answer you'll learn how to improve yourself.
